# PHY2010 Lab Manual

This document is the source-code for the lab manual for _Classical Mechanics and Electromagnetism_ (PHY2010). This is a third semester Physics core course at Ashoka University, and is the second lab course, following _An Introduction to Physics through Experiments_ (PHY1010).

This laboratory course runs parallel to two theory courses, one on Classical Mechanics and one on Electromagnetism. Its goal is to offer students the opportunity to study experimental problems related to the theoretical exercises they solve in class, while simultaneously developing the abilities required for experimental physics. 

The course comprises six experiments, with each experiment being assigned to a pair of students for two weeks. Just as in their previous lab course at Ashoka, students will be expected to be much more independent while carrying out the experiments than they were at school, while being given all necessary resources, including sophisticated equipment and help from more experienced hands. As they become more accustomed to the format and structure of this course, they will be encouraged to use their creativity to solve problems based on observations, measurements, data collection, analysis, and interpretation. 

The laboratory is based firmly on the principle that physics is an experimental science: observation and experimentation are just as important as concepts, calculations, and theory. These laboratory investigations should hopefully teach the student how to ask an interesting question of Nature, and then select the methods and apparatus needed to make progress towards finding an answer.
